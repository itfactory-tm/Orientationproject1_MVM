### README.md online customization by the team leader ðŸŽ“

1. Please update the contents of this README.md here. Be sure to include your team name and team members. The further instructions may be omitted.

### Cloning of the remote repo by the team ðŸ‘¤ðŸ‘¤ðŸ‘¤

1. Each team member makes an exact copy of this remote repo `git clone ...`

### Work with feature branches, pull requests and code reviews ðŸŽ“ðŸ‘¤ðŸ‘¤ðŸ‘¤

Be sure that each team member is working according to the same flow: 

1. Each team member always works on his/her own branch (= feature branch)
2. Once you finished a feature, you need to add a pull request (PR) 
3. Another team member checks this PR, comments on code and approves or disapproves the PR
4. If this PR is approved, a merge to the 'master' branch occurs
5. Before going through this process again, you do another pull on the master branch so that your new feature branch starts from the most recent version
